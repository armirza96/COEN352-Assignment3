SymbolsTable and Binary Search Tree implementations

Q1) Min/Max priority Queue implemenation using Min and Max heaps. Inserts values in O(logn) time, finds Max/Min in O(1) time and deletes in O(logn) time.

Q2) Implmentation of Java<Comparable> class to sort a records read in from a file.

Q3) A custom Symbol Table using a Binary Search Tree implementation (Hashmap, dictionary, associative array) that puts and ranks keys/values to by the key rank. Gets values in O(logn) time. 

Q4) A custom Symbol Table that uses an Ordered sequential search implemented in a linkedlist (Hashmap, dictionary, associative array) that puts and ranks keys/values to by the key rank. Gets values in O(n) time.
